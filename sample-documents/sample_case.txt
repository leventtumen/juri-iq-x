CASE OF AHMAD v. TURKEY

Application no. 40184/98

European Court of Human Rights

DECISION

As to the facts

1. The applicant was born in 1952 and lives in Istanbul.

2. On 15 March 1994 the applicant was dismissed from his position as a civil servant in the Ministry of Finance following disciplinary proceedings.

3. The applicant appealed against this decision to the administrative court. On 12 June 1995 the court rejected his appeal, finding that the dismissal was justified on the basis of alleged misconduct during his employment.

4. The applicant subsequently appealed to the Council of State (Danıştay). On 28 January 1997 the Council of State upheld the administrative court's decision.

5. The applicant claims that he was not given a fair opportunity to defend himself during the disciplinary proceedings and that the evidence against him was insufficient.

As to the law

6. The applicant complains under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the disciplinary proceedings were unfair.

7. The Court recalls that the requirements of Article 6 § 1 are applicable to disciplinary proceedings concerning civil servants.

8. The Court notes that the applicant was not given access to all the evidence against him and was not permitted to call witnesses in his defense.

9. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.

For these reasons, the Court unanimously

1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;

2. Holds that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, 10,000 (ten thousand) euros in respect of non-pecuniary damage and 2,000 (two thousand) euros for costs and expenses;

3. Dismisses unanimously the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.

Done in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 28 January 1999.
