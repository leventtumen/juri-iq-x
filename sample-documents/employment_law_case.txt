CASE OF KARADUMAN v. TURKEY

Application no. 33189/96

European Court of Human Rights

JUDGMENT

STRASBOURG

3 April 2001

FINAL

03/04/2001

As to the facts

1. The applicant, Ayşe Karaduman, is a Turkish national who was born in 1965 and lives in Ankara.

2. At the material time the applicant worked as a primary school teacher in a state school in Ankara.

3. In September 1993 the applicant was suspended from her teaching duties on the basis that she wore an Islamic headscarf at work.

4. On 15 October 1993 the applicant was dismissed from her position by a decision of the Ministry of National Education.

5. The applicant appealed against this decision to the administrative court. She argued that the dismissal violated her freedom of religion and her right to work.

6. On 8 March 1994 the administrative court rejected her appeal, finding that the wearing of a headscarf by civil servants was incompatible with the principle of secularism in Turkey.

7. The applicant appealed to the Council of State (Danıştay). On 19 December 1995 the Council of State upheld the administrative court's decision.

8. The applicant submitted that the prohibition against wearing a headscarf constituted an unjustified interference with her right to manifest her religion.

As to the law

9. The applicant complains under Article 9 of the Convention that the prohibition on wearing a headscarf violated her right to freedom of religion.

10. The Court recalls that Article 9 protects the freedom to hold religious beliefs and the freedom to manifest those beliefs in worship, teaching, practice and observance.

11. The Court acknowledges that the impugned measure constituted an interference with the applicant's right to manifest her religion.

12. Such an interference will be contrary to the Convention unless it is "prescribed by law", pursues a legitimate aim and is "necessary in a democratic society".

13. The Court accepts that the measure was prescribed by law and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and maintaining public order.

14. However, the Court considers that the dismissal of a teacher solely because she wears a headscarf is not necessary in a democratic society.

15. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 9 of the Convention.

For these reasons, the Court, by six votes to one,

1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 9 of the Convention;

2. Holds that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, 15,000 (fifteen thousand) euros in respect of non-pecuniary damage;

3. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.
